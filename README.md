# Hey, I'm Rayan 

I learn by building and build by learning, mostly with **AI, Automations, and lastly the web**.  
I share my journey in public: the wins, the mistakes, and the lessons that come with creating things from scratch.  
Curious about how **AI can move from static tools to adaptive systems/solutions**, always exploring ideas that make tech feel more alive and useful.
